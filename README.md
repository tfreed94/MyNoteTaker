## Description: 
This project was designed around connecting the front-end of an application to the back-end. The front-end code was already supplied so I was tasked with writing the code for the back-end. This application is a Note Taker that will take in user input and save the note to be called on again when it needs to be accessed.
## Installation: 
You will need to have express and nodes.js to run this application
## Usage: 
Node Server.js
